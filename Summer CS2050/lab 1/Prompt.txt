Implement a function that returns information relating to a dataset of integers in an array. Specifically,
the function must provide the total number of distinct values (i.e., non-duplicates) in the array and the
smallest value and largest value in the array. Below is a partial prototype for the function. You are free
to determine the full prototype, e.g., other parameters and return value (if there is one).


getArrayInfo(int *array, int n, ... ) // n is the size of array



HINT: The user of this function will expect three pieces of information from it, and since you can’t have
three return values, you’ll need to pass some or all the information to the user by reference.
